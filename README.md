Welcome to Guess the Word!

You have 10 guesses to see if you can guess the word that has been randomly selected.

Start by choosing a category and then start guessing! If you need a clue, click the button on the top right and if you're really stuck you can reveal the answer at the bottom.

If you choose 'random' as your category, a word will be selected out of all available options in the dropdown menu.

Below is a screenshot of the game in mobile view:

All words are accessed from an independent word bank typescript file which stores the word, it's category, it's clue and it's difficulty.
